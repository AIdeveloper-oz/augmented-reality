Augmented reality card based application with Python, numpy and OpenCV

# Usage


# Troubleshooting

If you get the message

```
Unable to capture video
```
printed to your terminal, the most likely cause is that your OpenCV installation has been compiled without FFMPEG support. Pre-built OpenCV packages such as the ones downloaded via pip are not compiled with FFMPEG support, which means that you have to build it manually.
